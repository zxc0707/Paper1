# Surveying Toronto residents' opinions on various applications covered by the City by-law

## Overview

This repository contains a paper Surveying Toronto residents' opinions on various applications covered by the City by-law. Effective public opinion polling has become a critical social activity that the city needs to pay attention to and implement. Specifically, residents' parking areas, safety areas, improvement areas, and traffic sound issues have become the focus of this research report. I think these applications deserve the spotlight.
